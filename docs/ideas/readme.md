## Header 1
and some text

## another header
### thing
blubber...

## some more things...

the idea is that ...
check out the [`POV` sub folder](POV/)

## wind rose
the printed graphics under the compass needle could also be turned individually -  
that gives a second level of abstraction -
here the idea is to rotate a thin acryl-plate - supported by 3 rollers around.
(where on is powered by a micro dc gear motor or something similar.. )
this needs some sort of indexing - so the thing knows where the disc is currently..
some illumination for this part should be also planned for..


## Lid
i think a lid that (eventually) can open and close to 'protect' the glass is a good idea.
on the top of the lid i think a [Flower of Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid) [(Blume des Lebens)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blume_des_Lebens) or [something similar](https://openclipart.org/detail/17495/decorative-flower) is a good art-work.
for example:
![Flower of Live](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flower-of-Life-small.svg)
or
![Flower](https://openclipart.org/download/17495/lemmling-Decorative-flower.svg)

## communication
the unit should have a W-LAN or 433MHz wireless communication link -
so it can be controlled from remote locations to set new values for position or text/image of needle or wind rose

## power
in the bottom of the unit needs to be place for some LiPo / LiFe cells...
if the housing is made with an inner width of 180mm (the outer width of the paper model)
then two 2s1p inline LiFePo4 packs with 26650 form-factor can fit in the bottom..

most power hungry is the POV section.. more details there..
